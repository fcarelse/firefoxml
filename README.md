You may need to create the chrome folder in your profile first of all as well as enable this legacy feature.

You will need to navigate to "about:config" in firefox and accept to make changes.

Then set "toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets" to true.

Also you need to set the Menu Bar to stay visible.

Use Alt-V, T, M to toggle the menubar being visible permanently.

Install "userChrome.css" to "C:\\Users\\&lt;user&gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\&lt;profile&gt;\\chrome\\"
Replacing &lt;user&gt; and &lt;profile&gt; as needed.
